# Step 5: Fuzzy Matching Engine

## Objective
Implement fuzzy matching algorithm to link digital and physical tracks, identifying gaps in collection.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and choose fuzzy matching library (fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz)
- [ ] Design matching algorithm (artist + title matching)
- [ ] Implement similarity scoring system
- [ ] Handle common variations (remixes, features, brackets)
- [ ] Create manual match override capability
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for matches
- [ ] Implement batch matching for performance
- [ ] Create match review interface (low confidence matches)

## Matching Strategy
1. Exact match on artist + title
2. Fuzzy match with normalized strings
3. Partial matches for remixes/variations
4. Manual override for edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately matches 90%+ of obvious duplicates
- [ ] Provides confidence scores for all matches
- [ ] Handles common track variations correctly
- [ ] Performance suitable for 3000+ track collections
- [ ] Manual override system works
- [ ] Clear indication of unmatched tracks
